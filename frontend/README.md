# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###push to git

1.Check git status
git status

2. add all changes
git add .

3.Commit your changes
git commit -m "Fix Monaco editor state, file upload, and C++ language support"


4.Push to GitHub
git push origin main

or if master?
git push origin master




FIRST TIME PUSH (repo exists but not linked)
🔹 Step 1: Initialize git (if needed)
git init

🔹 Step 2: Add remote repository

(copy URL from GitHub → Code → HTTPS)

git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git


Verify:

git remote -v

🔹 Step 3: Add, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
